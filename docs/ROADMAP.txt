Surrogacy CRM Platform — 12-Week Roadmap (AI-ready, Multi-tenant, OSS-ready)
Last updated: 2025-12-18

Assumptions (important)
- Multi-tenant via shared DB + shared schema, with `organization_id` on all domain rows.
- Each user account belongs to exactly ONE organization (no org switcher). If the same person works for another org, they create a separate account.
- Tenant context is derived from auth (JWT/session includes `org_id` and `role`); the client does NOT send an org id header/path for scoping.
- AI is optional (off by default) and BYOK (org-managed key stored server-side in DB, encrypted).

Week 1 — Setup & foundations (repo + tooling + skeleton apps) ✓ COMPLETE
Backend
✓ FastAPI project structure (`apps/api/app/`)
✓ Postgres connectivity (Docker Compose for dev)
✓ Alembic migrations + baseline migration (`0001_baseline.py`)
✓ Central request context dependency (`get_current_session` returns `{user_id, org_id, role}`)
✓ `/health` endpoint (DB connectivity test)
Frontend
✓ Next.js App Router + TypeScript strict
✓ Tailwind + shadcn/ui installed
✓ Layout shell (sidebar/topbar) + placeholder routes (`(app)/dashboard`, `(app)/leads`, `(app)/settings`)
Tooling/Process
- CI on PRs: (to be configured)
✓ `.env` settings documented in README (formal `.env.example` files pending)
Deliverable
✓ FE loads, BE loads, DB connects; skeleton exists

Week 2 — Auth + tenant isolation (the "don't regret later" week) ✓ COMPLETE
Backend
✓ Tables:
  ✓ organizations
  ✓ users
  ✓ memberships (user_id ↔ org_id ↔ role) with constraint enforcing 1 org per user (UNIQUE(user_id))
  ✓ auth_identities (SSO provider linking)
  ✓ org_invites (with partial unique index for pending invites)
✓ Auth: Google OAuth (Workspace SSO) + cookie-based session (JWT in HTTP-only cookie) + GET `/auth/me`
✓ Invite-only access (org_invites + CLI bootstrap command)
✓ Optional domain allowlist via `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`
✓ CSRF protection for mutations (`X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`)
✓ Centralized authorization helpers (role checks; membership checks) in `core/deps.py`
✓ Centralized query scoping helper: `get_org_scope` dependency
✓ Seed/bootstrap path:
  ✓ CLI: `python -m app.cli create-org` for first org + manager invite
  ✓ Dev-only endpoints (`/dev/seed`, `/dev/login-as`) guarded by ENV + X-Dev-Secret header
✓ Service layer: `auth_service.py`, `user_service.py`, `org_service.py`, `google_oauth.py`
✓ Schemas: `auth.py`, `user.py`, `org.py`, `invite.py`
✓ Fresh baseline migration: `0001_baseline.py`
Frontend (pending)
- Login page (React Hook Form + Zod)
- Route protection
