## 2025-05-20 - DropdownMenuTrigger Accessibility Pattern
**Learning:** `DropdownMenuTrigger` in this codebase (shadcn/ui) renders a button by default. Wrapping a styled `span` inside it for visual customization creates semantic issues (nested clickable elements if not careful) and misses accessibility features.
**Action:** Apply `buttonVariants` and `aria-label` directly to `DropdownMenuTrigger` instead of nesting styled elements.

## 2025-05-20 - Dynamic Icon Button Accessibility
**Learning:** In lists of items (like file attachments), icon-only buttons (download, delete) often lack context. Adding 'aria-label' with the item name (e.g., "Delete report.pdf" instead of just "Delete") is critical for screen reader users to know *which* item they are acting on.
**Action:** Always include dynamic context in 'aria-label' for repeated action buttons in lists.

## 2025-05-20 - Table Checkbox Accessibility
**Learning:** Table row selection checkboxes often lack accessible names. Adding dynamic `aria-label` (e.g., "Select {Name}") is essential for screen reader users to distinguish between rows.
**Action:** Ensure all selection checkboxes in data tables have unique, descriptive `aria-label` props derived from the row data.

## 2024-06-11 - Hide decorative icons in interactive elements
**Learning:** Decorative icons (like loaders, checkmarks, or X marks) placed inside interactive elements (like buttons) that already have visible text or an `aria-label` are read redundantly by screen readers if not hidden.
**Action:** Always add `aria-hidden="true"` to these decorative icons to keep the accessibility tree clean and improve the screen reader experience.
